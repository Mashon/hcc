##HTML/CSS Clone

####Setup

Create a new folder in your projects folder called `html-css-clone`

Inside this folder:
```
touch index.html
touch style.css
```

Think about the different boxes you're going to need to create in order to divide up the page. If it helps, you may want to open the mockup in an editor and go ahead and draw boxes around the various sections.

Once you have your layout thought out, create the html for the structure of your webpage.

Once the various headers, divs and images etc. have been laid out, use your knowledge of css to make the page resemble the mockup as closely as possible.


#####Some things to make sure of!
* Include title of page in the `<head></head>`
* Include meta tag for viewport
* Link to normalize.css
* Link to style.css
* Organize comments in your css
* You may only include screenshots of the images and logo. Everything else should be coded.
